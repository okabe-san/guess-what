## What is Guess-What?
This is a movie title trivia application. Learned how to work with an API and good data handling practices.

## How to play?
The user should select a year. The application will select a movie title for the year the user selected to play the game. Then click the Start the Trivia button. The game will start. When the game starts, information about the movie, or hints, will be displayed on the page. You will see blank spaces and it is the length of the movie title you need to answer. The letters of movie title will shows up slowly. You need to guess before the entire title shows up. After 3 guesses, the final score will shows up.
